# FAQ

### what is 3 degrees?
3 degrees is a network of matchmakers and their single friends. 

### how does it work?
1. If youâ€™re a matchmaker, you browse through the profiles of the singles who "belong" to your matchmaker friends. 
2. Like a match? Pair them up and a "proposal" is sent to both singles. 
3. If both singles agree with the match, they can start chatting within the app to set up a date .

### Can any random person see the singles' profiles?
Nope. Matchmakers have to give each other permission to view their singles. We want singles to feel secure in their privacy. 

### Seems like the best way to make matches or get "proposals" is to grow my network. How do I do that? 
Easy, for both singles and matchmakers: just send an invite from the app using your phone contacts list.

### what is the inspiration behind 3 degrees?
3 degrees is inspired by the Yale Freshman Screw, which is a campus-wide event where roommates set each other up on blind dates. 

### how does it differ from other dating sites?
The biggest difference is that 3 degrees is very matchmaker-driven. Singles play a secondary role, which a lot of people find refreshing. 

### Are we talking about professional matchmakers here?
Nope. Anyone can be a matchmaker. Generally though, we find that the people who want to be matchmakers are those already in relationships. 

### Why would matchmakers put in the time to set up their friends?
A 2014 study that came out of Harvard and Duke found that matchmakers are happier than non-matchmakers. Matchmaking is also a big part of many cultures. We think that most people would be willing to put in a small bit of time in order to help out their friends or family who haven't been so lucky in the modern dating scene. 

### How come singles can't browse other singles?
We really want to keep the ball in the matchmaker's court. This seems to take a lot of pressure off of the date. 

### Why do the singles have to be 3 degrees apart?
Other services link up singles via one matchmaker. We think this type of service is unnecessary because that's basically real life. If a person knows two singles who may make a good match, that person can probably just shoot both singles an email introduction. By using the networks of 2 matchmakers, the singles now have a larger, more varied pool of potential mates. 

### Can a single also be a matchmaker?
Currently our program can only support one type of version per phone. This may change in the future.
